## Hi there, my name is Kanyi ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. My interests are in Javascript and Python. I am currently learning Front End development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I am partially sighted due to a condition called Keratoconus. As a result, I am a disability activist. I want to build accessible websites so everyone can use them despite their physical or mental condition.
